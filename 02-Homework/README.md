PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
    The goal of this project was to create a day planner that users can use to store any notes they would like onto the page. In the header of the browser is the current date taken from the moments library. The day planner is broken up into hour blocks and covers the entire work day from 9am-5pm. In each hour block is a text box that the user can manipulate at any time to write down their notes. In order to save their note to the page, they click a save button so it will be there everytime they load the page. During the course of the day, the colors of each hour block are changing. For past hours, the block is gray, for the current hour, the box is red, and for future hours, the box is green. Users can change their notes one at a time whenever they wish, but I added a clear button on the page to wipe all notes from the planner as an alternative option. This way when the day is over, the user can clear the planner and start fresh for the next day.
